### _TutorialsNinja web application.

TutorialsNinja is dummy web application. It is a ecommerce web app. 
The URL of this web app is, https://tutorialsninja.com/demo
An e-commerce website is one that allows people to buy and sell physical goods, services, and digital products over the internet rather than at a brick-and-mortar location. Through an e-commerce website, a business can process orders, accept payments, manage shipping and logistics, and provide customer service.


I have successfully tested features of this web application and the test cases for the same are present in this repository.
